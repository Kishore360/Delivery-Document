"1"|"Lifecycle of all connected Data asset compared with lifecycle of Processing activity. Issue an error every time the highest lifecycle of all the IT Data Assets connected to the Ropa is higher than the Lifecycle status of the RoPA; when no IT Data assets are connected, skip this check. For what concerns the list of admittable lifecycle statuses for a RoPA and its Data Assetsm, there is an expectation that a system will always have a lifecycle such that the system is available and usable when the Processing activity is active. For instance, if the processing activity is in Leverage/Optimize, it is NOT OK that the system utilized is Decommissioned "|"Non-Vital"|"Inconsistent LifeCycle "|"10"|"1"
